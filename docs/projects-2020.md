TwentyTwenty is a simple PyQt app that I wrote.

This app is based on the 20-20-20 rule which you can read about in the links below. Basically, the rule says that every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This will help reduce:

- sore, tired or burning eyes
- blurred or double vision
- watery, itchy or dry eyes
- headaches

The app runs in the background and notifies you with a Windows 10 Toast + Sound notificaiton when itâ€™s time to look away and look back.

By no means should you consider this app as an alternative to a medical exam. If you feel any pain or discomfort while working on your computer, you should consult a medical professional. You can read more about the 20-20-20 rule here:
